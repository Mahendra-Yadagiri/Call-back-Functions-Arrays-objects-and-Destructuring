# Call-back-Functions-Arrays-objects-and-Destructuring
In this project, I worked with some core JavaScript and React concepts that make applications more powerful and maintainable:
ðŸ”¹ Callback Functions â€“ Passing one function as a parameter to another for flexibility and reusability.
 ðŸ”¹ Arrays â€“ Collections of ordered values, accessed using indexes.
 ðŸ”¹ Objects â€“ Collections of keyâ€“value pairs to structure related data.
 ðŸ”¹ Array Destructuring â€“ A concise way to extract specific values from arrays.
 ðŸ”¹ Object Destructuring â€“ A simplified way to access properties directly from objects.
